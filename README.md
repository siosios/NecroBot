## Developers and Contributors

### Requirements

To contribute to development, you will need to download and install the required software first.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/whatsnew/) - We are using C# 7.0 code so VS 2017 is required to compile.  VS 2015 or older will not be able to compile the code.
- [.NET 4.6.2 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53321)

### Cloning Source Code

Next, you need to get the source code.  This source code repository uses git submodules. So when you clone the source code, you will need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Necrobot-Private/NecroBot.git
```

Or if you already cloned without the recursive option, you can update the submodules by running:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Necrobot-Private/NecroBot.git
cd NecroBot
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Third Party Dependencies

NecroBot uses DotNetBrowser http://www.teamdev.com/dotnetbrowser, which is a proprietary software. The use of DotNetBrowser is governed by DotNetBrowser Product Licence Agreement http://www.teamdev.com/jxbrowser-licence-agreement. If you would like to use DotNetBrowser in your development, please contact TeamDev.
